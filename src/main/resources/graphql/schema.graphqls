type query{
    findDodBreed(id: ID!): String
    findAllDogNames: [String]
    findAllDogBreeds: [String]
}

type Mutation{
    createDog(name: String!, breed: String!,age: Integer!, origin: String!): Dog
    updateDog(id: ID!, name: String!, breed: String!,age: Integer!, origin: String!): Dog
    deleteDog(id: ID!): Dog

type Subscription{

    dogDeleted: Dog
}

The schema is pretty simple. We have a Dog type with three fields: id, name, and breed. We also have three queries, three mutations, and three subscriptions.
 The queries are pretty self-explanatory. 
The mutations are also pretty self-explanatory. The subscriptions are a little more complicated.
 We have three subscriptions, one for each mutation. The subscriptions will be triggered when a mutation is called.
The subscriptions will return the Dog object that was created, updated, or deleted.
